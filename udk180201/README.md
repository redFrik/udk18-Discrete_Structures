recapitulation
--------------------

a project with most of the examples from this semester...

* download the folder Discrete_Structures from this repository (go up one level, click the green button, download zip).
* start unity, click open and select the folder Discrete_Structures
* now try out the different scenes by double clicking on them

export

when you want to perform your unity work or share it with others, you can 'build' it. load a project and try...

* select File / Build & Run

![01build](01build.png?raw=true "01build")

this will produce a standalone application that should run on a similar machine as you used when building it.

* select Edit / Project Settings / Player

with the settings found here are also worth exploring. you can specify things like splash screen, icon, resolution etc.

![02playersettings](02playersettings.png?raw=true "02playersettings")

* select File / Build Settings...

here there are some more advanced options for build for older operating systems etc. with the WebGL module you can build your project to run on a webpage. anyone with a modern browser can see and interact with it.

![03buildsettings](03buildsettings.png?raw=true "03buildsettings")

similar with Android and iOS modules for running your project on devices with these systems.

just note that these modules require you to download and install big modules that take a lot of disk space and probably also sign up for developer accounts.

unity3d also offer building in the cloud.
